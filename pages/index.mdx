**Welcome!**

Hi, I'm Ayoub Ech Chamali, a 22 yo software engineer. 

I am an apprentice backend developer at [**Ilium**](https://ilium.co) where we work with crypto-currencies and blockchain to build a more decentralized world.

I am also a computer science student at [**Polytech Nancy**](https://polytech-nancy.univ-lorraine.fr/) in [**Université de Lorraine**](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/).

# My major is called IA2R, which stands for Automatique (control theory), Informatique (software engineering), Robotique (robotics) and Réseau (networking).

My work consist mainly on building APIs, but also managing databases and developping backend systems like CRONs, microservices, websockets, etc... mainly using Node and Typescript, Golang and SQL.

This portfolio is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
