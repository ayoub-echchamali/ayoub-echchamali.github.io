Hi, I'm Ayoub Ech Chamali, a 22-year-old software engineer.

I am an apprentice backend developer at [**Ilium**](https://ilium.co), where we work with cryptocurrencies and blockchain to build a more decentralized world.

I am also a computer science student at [**Polytech Nancy**](https://polytech-nancy.univ-lorraine.fr/) in [**Université de Lorraine**](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/), where I became familiar with robotics, control theory, networking, graph theory, machine learning, and optimization.

# My major is called IA2R, which stands for Automatique (control theory), Informatique (software engineering), Robotique (robotics), and Réseau (networking).

My work revolves around the world of web server, like building endpoints for our web applications, which includes tasks like managing databases and developing CRON jobs, microservices, websockets, RESTful APIs, etc., mainly using Node.js, TypeScript, Golang, and SQL.

During my academic years, I had the chance to work with many frameworks and technologies like:
- Frontend: tailwindCSS, anime.js, React, Next.js, nextra
- Backend: Nest.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Java Spring Boot, Laravel, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite
- Scientific computation: R language, Python (NumPy, scikit-learn), Matlab & Simulink
- Algorithms and general programming: C, C++, Java
- And many other complementary computer science skills, like scripting with Python and Bash, Docker, Git, ...

This portfolio is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It easy to use to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
