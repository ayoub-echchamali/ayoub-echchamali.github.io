# Ayoub Ech Chamali

Hey, I'm a backend developer at [**Ilium**](https://ilium.co). 
I mainly build APIs, work with databases and many other backend related tasks using Typescript, Golang, SQL and other languages.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
